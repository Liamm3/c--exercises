# C#-Exercises
These are the Exercises from the book 'C# f√ºr IT-Beruf' (C# for IT jobs)

## Workflow
1. Create branch for new exercise
2. Finish exercise in branch
3. Push branch
4. Open pull request
5. Merge pull request

## Naming of branches and commits
For a new Branch e.g.
```
git checkout -b 'exercise/4.2'
```
Every Branch gets an initial commit like this
```
git commit -m 'Initial commit 4.2'
```
Final commits before pushing and pulling are created like this
```
git commit -m 'Finish 4.2'
```
